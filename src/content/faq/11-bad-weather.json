  "question": "What happens if the weather is bad?",
  "answer": "We want flight training to be safe AND fun. It isn't safe if thunderstorms are in the area or the clouds are low. It isn't fun if it is really windy or turbulent or cold. Book your lesson when you can and if the weather is outside your comfort zone (or ours), we'll just cancel the lesson and fly on another day.",
