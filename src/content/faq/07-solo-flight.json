  "question": "When do I get to fly by myself?",
  "answer": "This will happen after both you and your instructor feel you are ready. The FAA requires you to have passed your flight physical, be 16 years of age, and your instructor has signed an endorsement in your logbook that you are ready. That first flight alone is referred to as your \"Solo\" and generally happens after 12 to 20 hours of instruction.",
