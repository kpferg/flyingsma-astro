  "question": "Should I take ground school before I start flying?",
  "answer": "There is no need for any bookwork before you take your first flight. There is some studying involved in flying, to learn the regulations and the inner workings of an airplane, but that can be done as you work on developing your flying skills. The FAA has a required written test, but it's multiple choice and they tell you the questions and possible answers beforehand, so don't sweat it. There are a lot of study aids, videos and classes available to help you learn the material. We can help you find one that works for your learning style.",
