  "question": "What type of aircraft will I be flying?",
  "answer": "Most of our students start their lessons in one of our Cessna 172's. These high wing four seat aluminum airplanes are known as \"Skyhawks\". They are comfortable, predictable and very well built, making them one of the most popular – and safe – training aircraft ever built.\n\nSome pilots really love to fly tailwheel airplanes and for them we have a Citabria. Ours was built in 2004, though the design dates back to Grandpa's time. It is truly \"stick and rudder\" flying, with fantastic visibility.",
