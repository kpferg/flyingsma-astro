  "question": "What is a \"Discovery Flight\"?",
  "answer": "A Discovery Flight is your first flight lesson. It is your introduction to the airplane and the world of flight. Actual flight time is about 30 minutes, during which the student takes the controls for some basic flight maneuvers. The instructor handles the take off and landing, with the student following along on the controls. At the end of the flight there will be a debriefing to go over the flight and to plan for your next lesson. Allow about one and a half hours. The cost is $155 and includes your first logbook.",
